Here is your master plan. This visualizes the "Low Stress / High Efficiency" strategy. It separates the **BM** (School/Theory) from the **EFZ** (Work/IT), showing exactly where to use your "System" and where to just coast.

### **🗓️ The Master Timeline (2025 – 2029\)**

This is the big picture. You are currently in Year 1\.

| Phase | Timeframe | Focus | Key Milestone |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Year 1** | Aug 2025 – Jul 2026 | **Base Building** | Keep averages safe. Set up 7-Cal routines. |
| **Year 2** | Aug 2026 – Jul 2027 | **Optimization** | **Apply for Praktikum** (Sep 2027). |
| **Year 3** | Aug 2027 – Jul 2028 | **The Finish Line** | **BM Exams** (Spring 2028). |
| **Year 4** | Aug 2028 – Jul 2029 | **The Payday** | **Internship (IPA)** & EFZ Diploma. |

**🎓 Part 1: The BM Strategy (Berufsmaturität)**

Logic: The final grade is 50% School Grade (Erfahrungsnote) \+ 50% Exam.  
The Hack: If you secure high School Grades using your System (Tier 1 subjects), you can afford to be "Average" in the final exams and still pass easily.

#### **🎯 Tier 1: The "Carry" Subjects (High ROI)**

*Use the System (7-Cal/Sleeve) to maximize School Grades here to buffer the exam.*

| Subject | School Target | Exam Target (Safe) | Final BM Grade | Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **INF 2** | **6.0** | *No Exam* | **6.0** | 7-Cal (God Mode). Boosts average massively. |
| **Math** | **5.5** | 4.0 | **4.8** | Use System for school grades. Exam is written only. |
| **FRW** | **5.5** | 4.0 | **4.8** | Use System for school grades. Exam is written only. |

#### **🛡️ Tier 2: The "Survival" Subjects (Low ROI)**

*Aim for safety. If the sleeve works, great. If not, Audio/Safe Average is fine.*

| Subject | School Target | Exam Target (Safe) | Final BM Grade | Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Deutsch** | **4.5** | 4.0 | **4.3** | Oral & Written Exam (50/50 split). |
| **Franz** | **4.0** | 4.0 | **4.0** | Oral & Written Exam (50/50 split). |
| **English** | **5.0** | 4.5 | **4.8** | You are naturally good. Coast. |
| **WR** | **4.5** | 4.0 | **4.3** | Written Exam only. |
| **History/Pol** | **4.5** | *No Exam* | **4.5** | School grade counts 100%. |

**📉 Worst-Case BM Average:** **\~4.7** (Comfortable Pass. Required: 4.0).

### **💻 Part 2: The EFZ Strategy (Fähigkeitszeugnis)**

Logic: This is your IT Degree. It is calculated completely differently from the BM.  
Formula: 50% IPA (Project) \+ 40% Modules \+ 10% ÜK.

| Component | Weight | Your Target | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Informatik Modules** | **40%** | **5.0** | Average of semesters 1–6 (INF1 \+ INF2 grades). |
| **ÜK (Courses)** | **10%** | **5.0** | External courses. Just show up and do the work. |
| **IPA (Project)** | **50%** | **4.8** | 10-day project in Year 4\. |

**📉 Worst-Case EFZ Grade:** **\~4.9** (Solid Pass).

**🏢 Part 3: The Internship (Praktikum)**

**Logic:** You need a chill job to survive the IPA without burnout.

* **Application Window:** **September 2027 – November 2027**.  
* **Target Companies:** Local administration (Gemeinde), internal IT support, SME maintenance. Avoid startups/agencies.  
* **The IPA (End Game):**  
  * **Duration:** 10 days (70-90 hours).  
  * **Task:** Do exactly what is asked. Document it well (20% of grade).  
  * **Goal:** A clean, boring 4.8.

### **✅ Summary of Targets**

* **INF 1:** **5.0** (Safe)  
* **INF 2:** **6.0** (Carry)  
* **Math/FRW:** **5.5** (School) \-\> **4.8** (Final)  
* **Languages:** **4.0 – 4.5** (Survival)

This plan ensures you pass both BM and EFZ with zero risk of burnout, using your "System" to inflate the school grades where it counts (Math/FRW/INF2) so you can relax during the actual exams.
